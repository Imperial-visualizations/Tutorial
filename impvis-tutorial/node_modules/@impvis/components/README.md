# VueJS Components for Imperial Visualisations
The Imperial Visualisations component library for VueJS provides a standardized set of components for educators & students to create powerful interactive educational visualisations.

## Installation
In order to use the library in your visualisation you wil need to use npm (or yarn) to install the package using: 
```
npm install --save @impvis/components
```
into an empty project created using the VueJS CLI. For instructions on how to do that, follow the [official VueJS guide](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/)

Once installed you will need to activate the component library plugin by adding the following the lines to your _main.js_ file:
```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import ImpVis from "@impvis/components"

Vue.use(ImpVis);
```

And that's it! The full library of Imperial Visualisation components will now be globally registered to your project allowing them to use them anywhere in your project. All Imperial Visualistions components are named beginning with the **iv-** prefix and for a full reference of the available components please see the **project wiki**.
