            <h1>But why work in partnership?</h1>
             </center>
            <p>Every problem at Imperial Visualisation is practically and intelligently solved, using experience, discussion with others, and a clear understanding of goals to make decisions. So why have we decided to work with partnerships between staff and students?</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>For the project:</b> Having students create visualisations gives the collective project an insight into how students learn while having academic staff ensures the academic integrity of produced content.</li>
                <li><b>For the staff:</b> Collaboration with students allows staff to reflect on teaching practices</li>
                <li><b>For the students:</b> Working as part of this project gives students an opportunity for professional development, it helps them become part of the academic community, and it allows them to get insight into modern teaching practices & educational design.</li>
            </ol>
