            <!--<h2>For STEMM students: </h2>-->
            <p>Welcome to the Imperial Visualisations community! We are excited that you are planning to create interactive visualisations for use in your STEMM lecture courses – they form an excellent learning tool to enhance students’ understanding of abstract concepts.</p>
            The creation of all of every visualisation of ours happens through staff-student partnerships. What does ‘working in partnership’ mean? There are three guiding principles of partnerships that we value particularly, and which set them apart from mere student participation or a student-supervisor style relationship. These are:
            <ol>
                <li>The partnership is based on mutual respect and draws its strength from <b>equally valuing staff and students' expertise</b>. Members of staff are experts in teaching and their subject-specific domain; students have the expertise of being learners. During the project, the students are likely to develop expertise in coding in Javascript and HTML.</li>
                <li>A partnership means <b>joint ownership</b> of both <b>the development process</b> and the <b>final visualisation</b>. Both staff and student(s) contribute to the decision-making of how to work on the visualisation, and both also make decisions on visualisation look and functionality.</li>
                <li>The <b>responsibility</b> for the visualisation and its development is <b>shared, but not equal</b>. It is jointly up to the staff and student(s) involved in the partnership to define who is responsible for what precisely, in particular, during the design process. Generally, there is an expectation that the student is responsible for the coding process, and the staff member is responsible for the technical correctness of the final product.</li>
            </ol>
