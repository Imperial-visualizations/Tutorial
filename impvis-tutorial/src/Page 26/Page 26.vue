                These legacy templates are not recommended for most people who want to create visualisations. 
                They do not contain the modern Vue component library created by the ImpVis team to help develop visualisations. 
                These templates are, however, useful for those who wish to get a simple, no batteries included environment to play 
                around with or for those who need a starting spot to upgrade old visualisations located on previous versions of the 
                ImpVis website. This template comes with the Math.js library preloaded for this reason, as it is a popular library 
                with many of the old visualisations.
