                By now, lecturers for the course you’re teaching, or people who may be interested in showing this
                content to students should be contacted, asking if they’re interested in hearing your ideas on how
                you’re visualizing the content of the suites. Showing them what you have/what you’re planning to
                have at this sort of stage is crucial, as it stops you moving too far without any misconceptions. You
                might find it surprising how many incorrect ideas make it this far, where it takes a lecturer to catch
                out any inconsistencies!
